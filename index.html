    <h1>Introduce Chongqing Exploration Narrative Games</h1>
    <p>
      I have created a simulation game that showcases the beautiful city of Chongqing. This game introduces various attractions in Chongqing, including Hongyadong, Kuixinglou, and Chaotianmen. It allows players to experience the charm of Chongqing without leaving their homes.
    </p>
    <h2>Let me introduce some of beautiful scenes in this game.</h2>

      Dazu Rock Carvings is an extraordinary UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Chongqing, China. It is renowned for its intricate and well-preserved stone carvings that date back to the 9th century.
    </p>
<p>The Dazu Rock Carvings cover a vast area and consist of over 50,000 statues, 100,000 Chinese characters, and numerous inscriptions spread across 75 protected sites. These carvings depict a wide range of subjects, including Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist themes, as well as historical events, folklore, and daily life scenes.
    </p>
<p>
  The craftsmanship and attention to detail in the Dazu Rock Carvings are truly remarkable. The sculptors utilized the natural contours of the rocks to create three-dimensional masterpieces, with exquisite expressions, delicate features, and intricate ornamentation. The carvings not only showcase the artistic skills of ancient craftsmen but also serve as a valuable historical and cultural record.</p>
  
<p>The riverside cruise in Chongqing is a popular tourist activity that offers visitors the opportunity to admire the magnificent scenery along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. These cruise ships are typically docked at the piers along the rivers and provide a leisurely and scenic journey for passengers.

The cruise ships often offer various amenities, including comfortable seating, dining services, and guided commentary, allowing passengers to fully appreciate the scenery and learn about the history and culture along the way.
